			<h1>Amazon Web Services: Hardware Behind The Cloud</h1>
			<p>Amazon Web Services is one of the most popular cloud based hosting platforms for websites and enterprise applications. AWS came about after Amazon built their own hardware for themselves but realized there was a profitable market in renting out server space they didn’t need to provide high reliability for web hosting at a low cost. The Elastic Computing Cloud service provided by Amazon benefits from being high customizable to your needs with multiple tiers which will be the main focus here. Surprisingly though AWS infrastructure is built from “commodity components” (1) with “nearly half a million servers.” (1)</p>
			
			<h2>Operating Systems</h2>
			<p>Amazon allows you to choose between 4 different operating systems Windows Server 2012, CentOS 6.5, Debian 7.4, and most importantly Amazon Linux. Amazon Linux is the most popular version that has been developed in house to provide customers with access to “various AWS services out the box.” (2)</p>

			<h2>General Purpose</h2>
			<p>There are two tiers in the general purpose section T2 and M3 that serve similar purposes but have a noticeable difference in the type of processor, amount of RAM, and storage space.</p>
			<p>T2 AWS provides you with 1-2 vCPUs which are based off the “High Frequency Intel Xeon Processors operating at 2.5GHz with Turbo up to 3.3GHz” accompanied by 1-4 GBs of RAM. To keep their systems T2 systems cost effective Amazon limits your CPU usage to only 20% however if you receive a burst of network traffic the CPUs will go above the 20% limit at the cost of CPU Credits that accrue every hour that your service is up.</p>
			<p>M3 hardware in the form of “High Frequency Intel Xeon E5-2670 v2 (Ivy Bridge) Processors” (3), SSD based storage for high I/O performance, and more memory. You’re now able to choose from 1-8 vCPUs with 3.75-30 GBs of RAM and SSD storage starts at 1 drive with 4 GBs of storage up to a RAID with 2 drives and 80 GBs of storage.</p>
			<h2>Compute Optimized</h2>
			<p>For services that require a lot of CPU computing power AWS offers a service that offers a wide range of 2-36 vCPUs based on the Intel Xeon E5-2666 v3 (Haswell) with 3.75-60 GBs of RAM. One of the more important aspects of the compute optimized selection is that they “almost take up the whole physical machine” (4)</p>
			<h2>Memory Optimized</h2>
			<p>The last major part of AWS is memory optimized which offers an astounding 15.25 – 244 GBs of RAM. They also run on the same processor as M3 systems using the Intel Xeon E5-2670 v2 (Ivy Brdige).</p>
